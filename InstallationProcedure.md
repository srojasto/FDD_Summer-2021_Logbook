# Before the installation 
## 12/07/2021
* Fix the LCS-fibres to the cases and store the fibre bundle in the boxes - **DONE**
* PMT-box instaallation rehearsal in the lab: **DONE**
  - Check if it is a good idea to install the PMTs in the cases before or after install the fibres **install PMTs before install the fibres**
* Splitter box characterization - **DONE**

## 13/07/2021
* Tape the "Y" junction of the fibre-bundles to make easy the handling during the installation
* Bottom PMT-box: 
 - check that the screws if the back are conical and the box is completelly attached to the wall
 - Replace FLAT screws for HEXAGONAL screws
* Move the detector to P2
* Store the preasambled detector in boxes and move it to P2
* Store the fibres and move to P2

# Instalation procedure
- Install PMT boxes **Maybe tomorrow (13/07/2021)**
- Fix the bottom half -> **Be careful to put the right side facing the wall and IP.**
- Fix the top half -> **Be careful to put the right side facing the wall and IP.**
- Install the fibre bundles of the TOP first. They are easier to handle and the position will make easier to keep them in place
- Install the BOTTOM fibres bundles: use velcro to fix the bundles in the bars to avoid to fall.
