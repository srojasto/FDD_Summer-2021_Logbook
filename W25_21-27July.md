## 24 July activities
- Plots of PMT gain
  *  Gain Curves Charge plots -> Upload plots and txt files
  *  Gain Curves Amplitude plots -> Upload plots and txt files
  * run 4 - voltage 1400 V -> bad alignement, redo needed?
 
- Splitter boxes:
  * ~~Decide the placement of the boxes according to their characteristics: remember that each box have to be placed in an specific place in the cavern.~~
  * Assembly: A-side splitter boxes already assambled -> C-side are left (one box need to be set and characterized)
  * Characterize Box-1
 
 - Laser calibration system setup
   * Install setup in laboratory
 
- Laser + FEE setup
  * Can we start to install and test the laser setup using the other half of the FDD-A or just some spare PMTs.

- Assemble the LCS box
  * design/plan the holes needed for the front and back panels
 
- Select ref. PMTs
- Changue the screws of the PMTbox (hexagonal on the sides)
- Extend study for the crosstalk test: Different intensities and systematic of the setup. **TODO with final setup of FDD-A** 

## To do in the cavern (next weeks)
- Replace CTP connectos to lemo-0
- meassure the distance from the PMTs to the patch pannel: to be sure that the length form the PMTs are enogh 
 * Make extensions if necessary
- Holes for survey in the frame
- Test accommodation of the PMTs in the box, together with the splitter boxes
- Install FDD-C PMTs -> test with laser or cosmics?
